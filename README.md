# cartrack-react
Displaying list of users using purely React and a few development dependencies.
It has the ability to search users by full name and email. You can utilise shortcuts to focus on the search field and clear the search field at any point on the page. I utilise Modular CSS which is defined as "... a collection of principles for writing code that is performant and maintainable at scale."
